# My First GitHub Project

Mostly, this will be a portfolio kind of website listing my projects & achievements with photographs of my Olympiad certificates too and a Resume plus my other interests & knowledge areas.
This project's basic idea is to make a photograph gallery of my Copyrighted images with a feature to hover over & magnify the images

And this repo is my stepwise progress with the fullstack course from Covalence.io
